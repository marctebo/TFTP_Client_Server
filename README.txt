Instructions on Running project

1. Compile and Run the Server.java file
2. Compile and Run the IntermediateHost.java file
3. Compile and Run the Client.java file 
4. Wait and Observe the output
5. If you wish to run the program again, make sure to terminate all currently running programs before doing steps 1-3

If this is done in Eclipse make sure to run the program as a Java Application (as said in assignment description).
If done in BlueJ just open 3 instances of the same project and repeat steps 1-3.

Happy Marking!
